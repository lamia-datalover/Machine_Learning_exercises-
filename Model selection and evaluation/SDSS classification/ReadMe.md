## Situation
The goal of this project is to work on a real dataset .
Using this data I classified observations of space in three different categories: stars, galaxies, quasars . 
## Task 
Classification of space observations in three different categories: stars, galaxies, quasars.
## Action
In my analysis, I delved into understanding the dataset, specifically focusing on the "redshift" column and its relationship with three specific categories. I proceeded with preprocessing tasks, removing unnecessary columns and checking if there are any missing values.

Following this, I trained a logistic regression model that yielded an intriguing score. To understand the contributing factors, I visualized the coefficients driving this score. Attempting to further enhance the model, I explored feature engineering, but although the score remained excellent, there was a slight decrease.

Undeterred, I expanded my approach by training an SVM model using an RBF kernel and a voting classifier combining SVM and logistic regression models. Ultimately, the SVM model proved superior in effectively classifying observations into the categories of stars, galaxies, and quasars
## Result
The goal of this exercise was to delve into a new dataset presenting a real classification problem. I'm glad to report that the problem was successfully resolved, achieving an interesting and notable score.
