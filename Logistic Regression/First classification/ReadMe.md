## Situation
This exercise aims to use what I have learned in the logistic regression course and gain a deeper understanding of these kinds of models .
## Task
Getting to know the dataset I am handling . Then, teach a model to recognize different groups or categories in the target variable.
## Action
At first, I looked into understanding different parts of the dataset, like the target variable, what kinds of columns there were, and if any data was missing. I also used scatter plots to explore the various categories within the target variable and used histograms to see which columns could tell us more about the target variable.

After that, I prepared the data for analysis. I trained a logistic regression model and found it gave an interesting score. I then wanted to dig deeper into this score. So, I used cross-validation to see how much this score might change, checking if the model might be too tailored to the training data (overfitting). I also used a confusion matrix and an ROC curve on both the training and test sets to understand how well the model performs on unseen data. This gave me an interesting conclusion about how reliable the model is in generating information for new data.

Finally, I plotted a decision boundary to visualize how the model categorizes data points. 

## Result


The objective was to accurately classify the categories within the target variable, and the training of this model was successful, displaying encouraging scores. I concentrated on understanding the standard metrics used to assess a logistic regression model. 
This exercise holds significance in learning how to address real-world classification challenges, enabling businesses to leverage insights and predictions for their benefit.
