# Preprocessing of titanic dataset游때
The goal of this exercise is to learn how to perform preprocessing using pandas library and sklearn .

## Situation游때
The dataset "titanic_advanced.csv" contains all the data about the titanic event, in order to benefit from its insights I needed to do some preprocessing before .

## Task游때
My task was to utilize pandas to leverage the data within the dataset, proceed with processing using sklearn, and ultimately train a linear regression model to predict the survival of passenger .

## Action游때
To begin with, I needed to familiarize myself with the dataset: understanding its shape, the available columns, and identifying the percentage of missing values in each column... The challenge arose when determining how to handle the useless columns such as 'Name,' 'HasCabin,' and 'Title.' Before removing them, I aimed to extract valuable insights from these columns. Following this, I proceeded to train a linear regression model using the appropriate columns

## Result游때
Achieving a high score with the trained model indicates that it successfully grasped the essential characteristics of the dataset and could generalize its findings to unseen data. Personally, I learned that immediately removing the useless columns isn't always the best approach. It's crucial to ask ourselves: "Is there any valuable information to extract from them before deciding to drop them?"
